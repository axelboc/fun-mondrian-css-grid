# Piet Mondrian, meet CSS Grid

This experiment is my attempt at building an artwork generator in the style of [Piet Mondrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Mondrian), more specifically of his famous grid-based paintings that involve thin black lines on white canvas and sparse use of the three primary colours: red, yellow and blue.

I'd been meaning to build a Mondrian artwork generator ever since I read [this article](http://vart.institute/mondrian/) by Jenn Schiffer back in 2014. Back then, Jenn used HTML tables, and I thought I could try doing something similar with an HTML5 `canvas`... but never got around to it.

Fast forward a few years and here comes [CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout)! I just had to try it out... Let's see where this goes! Check out the [_Releases_](https://github.com/axelboc/fun-mondrian-css-grid/releases) page for up-to-date information on my progress.
