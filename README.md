# Mondrian, meet CSS Grid

This **experiment** is my attempt at building an **artwork generator in the style of [Piet Mondrian]**(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piet_Mondrian), more specifically of his famous grid-based paintings involving thin black lines on white canvas and sparse use of the three primary colours: red, yellow and blue.

I've been meaning to build a Mondrian artwork generator ever since I read [this `var t;` article](http://vart.institute/mondrian/) by Jenn Schiffer back in 2014. Her experiment involved HTML tables, which I thought was fun. I long considered building my own version with HTML5 `canvas` but never got around to it. Fast forward a few years and here comes [CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout)! I just had to try it out... So, let's see where this goes!
